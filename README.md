# My nvim configuration

This is my Neovim configuration with lazy nvim.

The tree-sitter plugin was not working with GCC or clang compilers in windows, So I changed the compiler to zig.
When using this configuration you should have zig installed in your local machine or if your compiler work wiht this then you can remove the compiler setting from the `plugins/treesitter.lua`
